     Will compare files in two
      directories for missing
      and/or mismatched files
       (based upon md5sums).

      Currently a bit sloppy
       and lacks recursion.

This is a very small, as of yet, utility to compare the contents of a pair of directories. This became necessary when managing archived files with their originals and is likely quite useful for managing files/data across multiple systems (without using something overly complex like git/svn/cvs).

This currently does not recurse through any directories found within the 
targets.
